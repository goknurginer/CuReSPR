Description: CuReSPR is a software platform integrating two robust genomics data analysis libraries: edgeR (Empirical Analysis of Digital Gene Expression in R) and MAGeCK (Model-based Analysis of Genome-wide CRISPR Knockout) to analyse genome editing data. Genome editing allows researchers to selectively modify genes in an organism.
